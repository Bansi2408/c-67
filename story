Karen went for a work in a beautiful garden, full of tulips and butterflies. The little girl loved nature and always
enjoyed the fresh windsblowing though her hair.

She ran from one side to other, taking care not to damage flowers in the beautiful garden.

Suddenly, behind a big bush, she found a swing made from tree branches. Karen did not hesitate for a second and jumped 
into the swing, and began swinging so the wind dishevelled her hair.
